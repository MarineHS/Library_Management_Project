# Web Interface with Django

## Project Overview

The site is divided into three main sections:
- **the home page**. Display the library's oppening hours and a list of available activities
- **the catalog page**. Features a search bar  to find books by title or author; and a highlight section showcasing the books of the month.
- **the login page**. Allows both users and admin to log into their account using their email address.

Navigation between pages is done via the top navigation bar.

## App Structure

The site is built around four Django apps.

**The main app**

This app contains the templates for the home page.

**The catalog app**

The catalog app is used to manage the libraryâ€™s book collection and includes the search functionality.

Each book is identified by its ISBN. Additional information such as the title, author, summary and book cover can be added. Once a book is created, it is automatically marked as available for borrowing. It can also be flagged as featured to appear in the highlight section.

When a user search for a book (or an author), the app returns a list of matching results. The user can then click on a specific book to view its detailed information.

**The management app**

This app handles the borrowing and returning of books. It updates book availability automatically and tracks due dates. If a book is returned late, a warning is generated for the administrator.

**The user app**

The user app manages both basic and admin users which are identified by their mail address.

*Basic users*

Basic users can view the books they have borrowed and their due dates in their account. If a book is overdue, it is highlighted in red.

*Admin users*

Admin users can manage (add, remove, update) the books and users databases. They receive alerts if a book is overdue.
