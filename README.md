# :books: Create a library system

This project is a **library management system** featuring a collection of books from which we can search for a title or an author; and users who can borrow and return books.  

## :bulb: Project Goals  
The aim of this project was to build this management system using:  
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python**  
- an **SQL database**  
- a **web interface with Django**  

## :pushpin: Project Structure  
This project is divided into three folders, each representing a stage of development. Each folder contains a **README** detailing its functionalities and providing code examples. 

- **`Library_basic`** 

This folder contains a Python script implementing the basic operations of the library. A markdown file lists the commands available to manage books and users.

- **`Library_SQL`** 

As the initial Python version required data to be reloaded each it was used, an SQL database was introduce to store book and user information permanently.

- **`Library_web`**

Finally, to make the system more user-friendly and realistic, a web interface was developped using Django. As this was my first experience with Django, HTML and CSS, the features and the design of this website are simple.
