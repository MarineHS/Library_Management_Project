# Library System with Python

This project is a simple **library management system** featuring a collection of books from which we can search for a title or an author and users who can borrow and return books.  

## Project Goals  
The aim of this project is to:  
- Apply **object-oriented programming (OOP) in Python**  
- **Manage project versions with Git**  
- Gradually **integrate SQL queries**  
- Develop a **web interface with Flask**  

## Project Structure  
This project is divided into three folders, each representing a stage of development:  
- **`Library_basic`** â†’ Initial version focusing on OOP principles.  


Each folder contains a **README.md** detailing its functionalities and providing code examples.
